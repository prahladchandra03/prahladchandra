## 💡 Code Philosophy

```javascript
// Clean Code Principles I Follow
const myCodePhilosophy = {
    readable: "Code is read 10x more than it's written",
    maintainable: "Write code that others (and future you) can understand",
    scalable: "Design with growth in mind from day one",
    tested: "Test-driven development saves debugging time",
    documented: "Good documentation is as important as good code",
    performant: "Optimize for user experience, not premature optimization"
};

// My Development Approach
const developmentWorkflow = {
    plan: "Understand requirements thoroughly before coding",
    design: "Architect the solution with scalability in mind",
    develop: "Write clean, modular, and reusable code",
    test: "Test early, test often, test thoroughly",
    deploy: "Automate deployment with CI/CD",
    monitor: "Track performance and fix issues proactively",
    iterate: "Continuously improve based on feedback"
};
